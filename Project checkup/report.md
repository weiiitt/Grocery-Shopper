# Project Check-in

## Summary
A lot of work has been done in terms of computer vision and object detection. The robot is capable of real time object detected and 3d object segmentation which we can use to determine required positions for inverse kinematics

### [D5] Manipulation
- **Lead:** Nikko Gajowniczek
- **Target Completion:** April 21
- **Progress**: Gripper opens and closes

### [D6] System Integration & Teleoperation
- **Lead:** Wei Jiang
- **Target Completion:** April 30
